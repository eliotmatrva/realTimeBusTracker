# realTimeBusTracker

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This web app gets the current locations of all Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority ("MBTA") buses, then plots them on a map.
General features:
1. MBTA bus locations refreshed every 15 seconds.
2. Buses are color coded, and the included legend provides the bus IDs for each color.

<h2>How to Run</h2>

</ul>
(2) Open index.html in your favorite (and modern) browser.
